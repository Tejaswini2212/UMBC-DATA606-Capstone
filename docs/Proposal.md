## 2. Background
Personal finance management has become increasingly challenging in todayâ€™s digital world. People often struggle to keep track of their spending across multiple accounts, which leads to overspending and poor saving habits. While banks provide statements, they are not user-friendly for day-to-day financial decision-making. At the same time, many individuals hesitate to invest due to a lack of awareness about safe and suitable options.

**ðŸ’µWhat is this about**
- This project is about creating a financial chatbot that helps users manage money more effectively. It can read bank statements (CSV/PDF), categorize expenses, track savings, and suggest suitable investment options based on user risk levels. Using conversational AI, it provides an easy way for users to ask questions about their finances and receive personalized, actionable advice.

**Why it matters**  
- Managing personal finances is often confusing and time-consuming. Many people struggle with tracking expenses, saving consistently, and choosing safe investments. A chatbot that simplifies these tasks makes financial management more accessible, personalized, and effective, acting as a virtual advisor without the need for expert knowledge.

**Research Questions**  
1.How can expenses be automatically categorized from raw bank transaction data?</br>
2.What methods can be used to analyze spending and identify savings potential?</br>
3.How can the chatbot provide personalized, risk-aware investment recommendations? </br>
